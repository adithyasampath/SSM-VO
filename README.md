We take inspiration from MotionHint paper for defining a Motion model for SSM-VO models like MonoDepth2 to avoid the local minima probelm in teir consistency loss.

1.  PPNet Motion model, as seen `networks/PPNet` is defined as sequence models like LSTM, Stacked LSTM, GRU, Stacked GRU, and Transformer.

2. define the dataloader in `networks\ppnet_dataloader`, with pose centralisation and scale augmentation.

3. itionally, we also define the loss function for the PPNet model as a modified negative log likelihood loss in `network\ppnet_loss`.

4. We define the training and validation helper functions in `networks\ppnet_trainer`.

5. Finally, to train the PPNet model, we run `networks\ppnet_main`. Once we have a trained PPNet Motion model, we use it to train the end-to-end network with MonoDepth2 SSM-VO using the steps described in the original repository below.

## ⚙️ Setup

First, assuming you are using a fresh [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) distribution, you can set up the environment with:
```shell
conda env create -f environment.yaml
```

This command will install all packages used during training and testing.

## Dataset

You can download the KITTI Odometry dataset from [here](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_odometry.php).
You need to download the color odometry dataset (~65GB) and the ground truth poses (~4MB), and organize them as:

```

│   │   00.txt
│   │   01.txt

|   |   21.txt

```

## Training

To train our MotionHint models, you need to first download the pretrained model of [Monodepth2](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TwdYB8B3sB9NyWR9Q4eNVtOnQ1B4Fxu9?usp=sharing), and replace 'PRETRAINED_MONODEPTH2' in all training scripts with your own path.

Using the shell scripts in ```./scripts```, you can train the self-supervised visual odometry with our MotionHint.

There are totally three setups in our paper,

**If you want to train the network using *'Ground Truth'* setup**, you should run:
```shell
./scripts/train_gt_setup.sh 0     # 0 infers using the gpu 0.
```

**If you want to train the network using *'Paired Poses'* setup**, you should run:
```shell
./scripts/train_pair_setup.sh 0     # 0 infers using the gpu 0.
```

**If you want to train the network using *'Unpaired Poses'* setup**, you should run:
```shell
./scripts/train_unpair_setup.sh 0     # 0 infers using the gpu 0.
```

Before running all scripts, you need to change the values of 'DATA_PATH' and 'LOG_PATH' in the scripts. The models will be saved in ```LOG_PATH/models```, and the latest model will be used for evaluation.

You can also change some parameters in scripts and ```options.py``` to do some ablation study.

## Evaluation

We directly employ [the KITTI Odometry Evaluation Toolbox](https://github.com/Huangying-Zhan/kitti-odom-eval) to evaluate our models. For convenience, we have integrated the toolbox into our code, and written a script to do the evaluation.

**If you want to evlaute a MotionHint model**, you can run:
```shell
./scripts/eval_model.sh YOUR_MODEL_PATH EVALUATION_NAME
```
The evaluation results will be shown in the terminal, and saved in ```./evaluations/result/EVALUATION_NAME```.

All models above are trained for 20 epochs, and then **the lastest version** is taken as the final model.
